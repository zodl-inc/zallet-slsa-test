# Installation

There are multiple ways to install the `zallet` binary. The table below has a summary of
the simplest options:

| Environment | CLI command |
|-------------|-------------|
| Debian | [Debian packages](debian.md) |
| Ubuntu | [Debian packages](debian.md) |

> Help from new packagers is very welcome. However, please note that Zallet is currently
> ALPHA software, and is rapidly changing. If you create a Zallet package before the 1.0.0
> production release, please ensure you mark it as alpha software and regularly update it.

## Choosing a chain backend

Zallet supports two chain backends. Each is a separate binary (built from its own cargo
workspace, so the two can track different `zebra` releases), and the `zallet` command is
a small launcher that runs whichever backend your config file names:

```toml
# zallet.toml — the default if the key is absent is "zebra-state"
backend = "zaino"
```

| Backend | Default | Platform | Reaches the chain via | Requires | Regtest |
|---------|:-------:|----------|-----------------------|----------|:-------:|
| `zebra-state` | Yes | Linux only | co-located `zebrad`'s state database (`ReadStateService`) | `zebrad` built with the `indexer` feature + `[indexer.read_state_service]` config + shared state dir | No |
| `zaino` | No | Linux, macOS, Windows | co-located `zebrad`'s JSON-RPC endpoint (optionally reads state directly when `[indexer.read_state_service]` is set) | co-located `zebrad` JSON-RPC endpoint | Yes |

The **`zebra` backend** is the default. It reads finalized chain state directly from
a co-located `zebrad`'s state database and is the recommended choice for production
mainnet use on Linux. It **only works against a `zebrad` built with the non-default
`indexer` feature**.

The **`zaino` backend** fetches chain data over JSON-RPC. It is the only backend that
supports regtest and non-Linux platforms, and it does **not** require the `zebrad`
`indexer` feature — so it is the right choice when Zebra and Zallet run as separate
services/containers over JSON-RPC (for example, the stock `zfnd/zebra` images or the
[z3](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/z3) stack), or when you need regtest.

### Pre-compiled artifacts (Docker image / Debian package)

The official Docker image and Debian package ship the launcher and **both** backends:

| Binary | Role | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| `zallet` | launcher | the default command / image `ENTRYPOINT`; dispatches on the config's `backend` key |
| `zallet-zebra` | `zebra` backend | directly runnable |
| `zallet-zaino` | `zaino` backend | directly runnable |

All three share the same CLI surface, config format, and subcommands; only the chain-data
backend differs, and you can bypass the launcher by running a backend binary directly (it
will refuse to run against a config whose `backend` key names the other backend).

The GitHub Releases page ships all three as a single tarball per platform,
`zallet-<version>-linux-<arch>.tar.gz`, containing `zallet` (the launcher), `zallet-zebra`,
and `zallet-zaino`, plus shell completions, man pages, and the third-party license
inventory under `share/`. Extract it and run `./zallet -h`, or run a backend binary
directly to bypass the launcher.

### Building from source with a chosen backend

Each backend is its own package in its own cargo workspace, so you install the one you
want by name (plus the launcher, if you want config-driven dispatch):

```
# The zebra-state backend (Linux only)
cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/zcash/zallet.git zallet-zebra

# The zaino backend
cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/zcash/zallet.git zallet-zaino

# The launcher (optional; dispatches to whichever backend the config names)
cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/zcash/zallet.git zallet
```

Backend-independent features such as `rpc-cli` and `zcashd-import` are enabled per
backend package with `--features` as usual.

## Pre-compiled binaries

> WARNING: This approach does not have automatic updates.

Executable binaries are available for download on the [GitHub Releases page].

## Build from source using Rust

> WARNING: This approach does not have automatic updates.

To build Zallet from source, you will first need to install Rust and Cargo. Follow the
instructions on the [Rust installation page]. Zallet currently requires at least Rust
version 1.88.

> WARNING: The following does not yet work because Zallet cannot be published to
> [crates.io] while it has unpublished dependencies. This will be fixed during the alpha
> phase. In the meantime, follow the instructions to install the latest development
> version.

Once you have installed Rust, the following command can be used to build and install
Zallet:

```
cargo install --locked zallet
```

This will automatically download Zallet from [crates.io], build it, and install it in
Cargo's global binary directory (`~/.cargo/bin/` by default).

To update, run `cargo install zallet` again. It will check if there is a newer version,
and re-install Zallet if a new version is found. You will need to shut down and restart
any [running Zallet instances](../../cli/start.md) to apply the new version.

To uninstall, run the command `cargo uninstall zallet`. This will only uninstall the
binary, and will not alter any existing wallet datadir.

### Installing the latest development version

If you want to run the latest unpublished changes, then you can instead install Zallet
directly from the main branch of its code repository:

```
cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/zcash/zallet.git
```
